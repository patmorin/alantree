\section{The Exponential Process (First Passage Percolation)}

Consider the following process for growing a spanning tree, $T$, of an
$n$-vertex connected undirected graph $G$ starting from a distinguished
vertex $s\in V(G)$.  On each edge of $G$ we attach an exponential timer
with rate 1. When the timer on an edge $vw$ rings the timer is immediately
reset and, if exactly one of $v$ or $w$ is in $T$, then the edge $vw$
is added to $T$.  We call this \emph{Process~E} and we say that Process~E
is \emph{complete} once $T$ spans $G$.

\begin{lem}\lemlabel{percolation}
  If $G$ has diameter $D$ then, with probability at least $1-1/n$, $T$
  is a spanning tree after time at most $c(D+\log n)$.
\end{lem}


\begin{proof}
  Let $v$ be a vertex of $G$ such that there exists a path
  $v_0,\ldots,v_k$ of length $k$ in $G$ from $s=v_0$ to $v=v_k$.
  Let $e_i=v_{i-1}v_i$ be the $i$th edge on this path.

  For each $i\in\{1,\ldots,k\}$, the vertex $v_i$ joins the tree at some
  time $t_i$.  Once this happens, the vertex $v_{i+1}$ will join the tree
  at or before the next ring of the timer on edge $e_{i+1}$.  (Note that
  $v_{i+1}$ may join the tree before this ring and even before $t_i$.)
  By the memoryless property of exponentials, this next ring occurs at
  time $t_i+Z_i$ where $Z_i$ is a an exponential random variable with
  rate 1.  Therefore, the random variable $t_k$ is dominated by the sum
  of $k$ independent exponentials $Z_1,\ldots,Z_k$.
  In particular, using standard concentration results \cite{X},
  \[
      \Pr\{t_k\ge c(k+\log n)\} \le \Pr\{Z_1+\cdots Z_k\ge c(k+\log n)\} \le 1/n^2 \enspace .
  \]
  For each $v\in V(G)$, let $t(v)$ denote the time at which $v$ joins
  the tree $T$ and define $t=\max\{t(v):v\in V(G)\}$
  as the time at which the last vertex of $G$ joins 
  $T$.  Then,
  \[
      \Pr\{t> c(D+\log n)\} \le \sum_{v\in V(G)}\Pr\{t(v) \ge c(D+\log n)     
       \le 1/n \enspace . \qedhere
  \]
\end{proof}

\section{The Random Edge Choice Process}

Now note that the tree, $T$, that results from the preceding process
is distributed in the same way as the spanning tree that one gets by
starting with the tree $T=(\{s\},\emptyset)$ and repeatedly choosing
a uniform random edge $vw$ and adding $vw$ to $T$ if and only if $vw$
has exactly one endpoint in $V(T)$.  We call second version Process~B.
That Process~E and Process~B produce identically distributed spanning
trees follows from the memorylessness of exponential random variables.
In particular, at any point in time, each of the $|E(G)|$ timers in
Process~E is equally likely to be the next timer to ring.

\begin{lem}
  If $G$ has diameter $D$ and maximum degree $\Delta$ then after running
  Process~B to completion, with probability at least $1-O(1/n)$, the spanning
  tree $T$ has diameter at most $2c\Delta(D+\log n)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  Let $P=v_0,v_1,\ldots,v_L$ be some simple path in $G$ starting at
  $s=v_0$ and let $e_i=v_{i-1}v_i$ be the $i$th edge on this path.
  In the model of Process~E, this path can not appear before the timer
  on $e_1$ rings, and then the timer on $e_2$ rings, and so on, until the
  timer on $e_L$ rings.  Let $t_L$ be the time at which this first occurs.
  Then $t_L$ is lower-bounded by the sum of $L$ independent exponential(1)
  random variables.  Using Chernoff's bounding technique, we can show that,
  for any $d > 1$,
  \[
      \Pr\{t_L\} \le L/d \le \exp(-L(\ln d - 1+1/d)) \le \left(\frac{e}{d}\right)^L \enspace .
  \]
  If $P$ appears in $T$, then either $t_L < c(D+\log n)$ or $T$ is not
  yet a spanning tree of $G$ at time $c(D+\log n)$.  
  Therefore, 
  \[
      \Pr\{\text{$P$ appears in $T$}\} \le 1/n 
        + \left(\frac{ec(D+\log n)}{L}\right)^L \enspace .
  \]
  Let $P_L$ be the set of all simple paths in $G$ that start at $s$ and have length $L$.  The probability that $T$ contains any path from $P_L$ is at most
  \[
      1/n + |P_L|\left(\frac{\Delta ec(D+\log n)}{L}\right)^L 
      < 1/n + \left(\frac{\Delta ec(D+\log n)}{L}\right)^L \enspace ,
  \]
  since $|P_L|\le \Delta^L$.
  Finally, the probability that $T$ contains any path of length at least
  $L'=2\Delta ec(D+\log n)$ is at most
  \[
     \frac{1}{n}+\sum_{L=L'}^{n-1} \left(\frac{\Delta e L}{c(D+\log n)}\right)^L <  \frac{1}{n}+\sum_{L=L'}^{n-1} (1/2)^L < 2/n \enspace . 
  \]
\end{proof}
