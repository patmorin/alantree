Referee: Page 1, line 2 in the subsection with the heading “our results”: This
referee suggests to insert the word “rooted” in the phrase “the height
1of a tree T .” That is, this referee suggests to write “and let us denote
the height of a tree T rooted at s by h(T, s).” The height does not
have a meaning, unless there is a reference point (the root).

Response: We have added the word "rooted" before tree in this sentence. We are relunctant to use $h(T,s)$ for this notation since that will lead to the awkward $h((T(G,s),s)$ throughout the rest of the paper.  This should be sufficient, since T(G,s)$ has already been defined as a random spanning tree rooted at s.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: The itemized list of results on Page 1 has the factors ∆ and D. At a
first glance, the results looked strange. Upon taking a second look, one
realizes that ∆ and D can be growing with n. For example, ∆ = ∆(n)
in a star is n − 1. So, this referee suggests to mention, at least once at
the beginning, that ∆ = ∆(n), and D = D(n) are functions of n. Once
the link to n is established, the notation can be relaxed by dropping n
in all subsequent presentations.

Reponse: We have added the following sentence, just before the list of results:

"In all of these results, the reader should keep in mind that the diameter, $D$,
the maximum-degree, $\Delta$, the degeneracy, $d$, and the edge-expansion
factor, $\Phi$, may be increasing functions of $n$, the number of vertices
in $G$."

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee:  In item (3) of the list of results, please insert a space in “treewidth” to become “tree width.”

Response:  We would prefer to stick with the single word treewidth, as that seems to have become the standard terminology in graph theory. See, for example: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treewidth#References

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: Page 3, seven lines above the title of Section 2: Period (not comma)
before “In Section 3.” The referee also suggests a comma after “In
Section 3,” and after similar grammatical constructs.

Response: Corrected.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: Page 4, right before Display (1): The referee suggests adding “we have.”
Without this phrase, the sentence has no verb. One could interpret the
sign ≤ as “is less than” providing the verb. But, it is a better practice
to take a display like (1) as a black box, not to be opened to take
grammar from within. Think of the difference between Then x = y
(then blah), versus, then we see that x = y (then we see blah).

Response: We are reluctant to make this change since we don't agree that a display (or inline) formula is a black box. Rather, it does contain grammar and, in particular, the verb "is" is contained in the < symbol.  Otherwise, every sentence like

"If $a< b$ then $b>a$." would have to be written like "If we have $a<b$ then we have that $a>b$." 

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: Page 3, Display (1): In this display, and many similar ones, it may be
better to use the more modern symbol P for orobability. You can get it
using \mathbb. Also, you can type d 1 . One might be inclined to typeset
1/d to save space, but the right-hand side is building up a fraction in
two lines, anyway. The typesetting d 1 will be gentler on the eyes.

Response: We have changed to using $\mathbb{P}$ for probability and used \frac{1}{d} here, as suggested.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: Page 4, Lemma 2: Can you please add a verbal argument in the proof
to justify items 1 and 2?

Response: We have added text here to make it clearer why one of these two conditions must occur. (If the tree contains a long path then it contains a heavy path or it contains a long light path.)

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: Page 6, list of bulleted items: In the first bullet, isn’t this Kuratowski’s theorem? It may be a good idea here to give a reference to Euler genus formula.

Response: Actually, this is Euler's formula.  We have added a reference to the exact location this argument is used in Bondy and Murty's Graph Theory text.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: Notation here is not completely standard, e.g., I have not seen the
"element of" epsilon symbol used in the statement that one quantity
is \Omega of the other.  Probably everyone who expects an equal sign
there will catch on, but a warning would be nice.  

Response: We have switched to the more common = notation.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: Also, using log for
log_2 and \ln for natural log and never using common log is fine in CIS,
but wouldn't it be less distracting just to use an unambiguous notation
like lg ?  

Response: We have double-checked and we only use log_2 n for binary logarithm and ln n for natural logarithm. All of occurrence of log n are within asymptotic notations where the exact base of the logarithm is irrelevant.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: Also, in the probability world, sums of IID exponentials are
called Gammas, not Erlangs.

Response: We have changed Erlang to Gamma throughout

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: The term "(s,v) path" is not standard in my world, though we can tell what
it means here; please introduce it.

Response: We have changed both occurrences of (s,v)-path to "path from s to v".

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: Before (2), you say for all t > 1, which is of course true, but the truth
is vacuous unless t >= 2.

Response: We have changed this to t>=2.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: Why is the proof of Lemma 1 in an appendix?  It would seem better in
Section 2 "Preliminaries".  

Response: We chose to put the proof of Lemma into the appendix because we found it simple, but just long enough to distract from the main story.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: In Lemma 16, if the {Z_i} variables are really supposed to be IID, then
the pairs (s_i , v_i) must all be at the same distance.  Is this intended?

Response: The referee is correct. We meant independent here, but not identical, and have changed the statement of the lemma accordingly.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Referee: This is really minor, but when you quote a result from [9], it would
help if this could be replace

Response: We changed the reference to the journal version of this paper.
